Life cycle

node first executes main function (just as java, etc)
main executes line per line (call stack).
every line is either executed or saved for later execution.

In case of async funcs, the processes enter the node apis 
(process stack), and node is checking for their resolves.

When a process resolves, it goes to the callback queue.
The callback queue is executed after the call stack finishes,
by reading all the code. 

The processes in the queues re enter the call stack for execution.

If there's nothing to execute in queues, the program finishes.
